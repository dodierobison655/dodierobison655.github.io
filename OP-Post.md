  As we enter 2017, I find myself scolding my naivety and quick tendencies to accept whatever media is presented to me, 
whether it be videos, news, speeches, or opinions from figures I respect as honest, benevolent, and trustworthy. Almost 
every time I find another source which utterly disproves the previous subject, and even reveals deliberate lies in the 
original source. I find this abundant in entertainment, and politics. To me, deception is the most efficient way to dispel 
my intrigue and enjoyment. 

  For example, a problem I have encountered and mulled over for the first time is the fabrication of happiness in the 
entertainment business, or any personality for that matter. I had been drawn to Jimmy Fallon’s personality, which I believe
is a result of his constant laughter and positive attitude. It lures you in, but it might not be truthful, and yet, if it 
is a facade, does it even matter? Another example is prank videos, or ‘social experiments’ which accrue millions of views 
on Youtube. These examples tempt you with a conclusion that would satisfy you to be true, but are almost always fake from 
the beginning. They prey on people’s superiority complex, so they can look down on those appearing in supposedly real videos,
when they are inevitably actors. It seems as though entertainment has no obligation to be truthful to you, but even if you 
can’t prove it’s false, it seems near impossible to prove if it’s genuine. We have to form our most accurate conclusions on
the genuineness of the people we idolize, if honesty is what we prioritize.

  The other end of the spectrum we have politics and the media, where most of the sources are obviously biased. To me, it feels 
like liberals tell you that they are the moral side, and stand up for all the minorities that are being oppressed by the demonic
conservatives, whom have no moral compasses, and are overflowing with racism, sexism, and homophobia. They act like politicians 
are fear-mongers who don’t care about poor people, and insinuate conservatives want all women to be burned at the stake. My 
family goes on rants similar, but to a lesser extent, to the argument above (mostly pertaining to Trump). Something that disturbed
me was when my sister brought up how all the kids at Lamar Middle School, including her, hate Republicans. When I asked her why, 
she said, ‘because they are mean’, and that was where here reasoning started and ended, with no further details. It amazes me how 
generalizations are so antagonized by Democrats when many of them actively demonize a whole political group, without an actual reason.

  Next is the conservative spin, and by the way, this OP is based on what I have encountered in the media. They inform me 
that liberals are uneducated people whining about concepts that aren’t an issue anymore, claiming white men are demonized
by the Social Justice Warriors of the left. Honestly, I’ve been in contact with much less conservative media because of 
the city I live in, and my family, which are both extremely liberal. Having less contact gives me less information and 
therefore not as many hypocrisies to criticize. The idea is, at this point I have no idea whether these ideologies are 
both wrong, one side is the objective greatest, or if everyone is the complete antichrist/idiot that the other claims.

  I think recent years are not the origin of corruptness, but just the beginning of when I notice and care about it. We 
should all take what people tell us with a grain of salt, and know that people have no obligation to be truthful to us,
even if they are in a position of power.
