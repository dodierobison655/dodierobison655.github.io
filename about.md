Hello, Iâ€™m Deral Robison, and this is my new blog. I want to learn more about github, and programming as well,
so I will use the website for organizing my projects, and maybe for technical blogging once I feel comfortable with it.
I feel this will be a great experience when it comes to making various projects and putting them online where they are 
easily accessable, and also composing and writing my thoughts and techniques I have while creating projects.
