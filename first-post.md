Hello, Iâ€™m Deral Robison, and this is my new blog. I want to learn more about github, and programming as well, so I will use the website as a mix of technical and personal blogging. I feel this will be a great experience when it comes to making various projects and putting them online where they are easily accessable, and also composing and writing my thoughts and techniques I have while creating projects and in general.

I am a student and programmer open to learning developing skills and getting experience from projects and games I've made. I find a lot of things interesting, like politics, technology, and television/video games.

**Thanks for reading, I hope to continue posting and delevoping!**
