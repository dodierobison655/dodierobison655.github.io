Hello, Iâ€™m Deral Robison, and this is my new blog. I want to learn more about github, and programming as well, so I will use the website for organizing my projects, and maybe for technical blogging once I feel comfortable with it. I feel this will be a great experience when it comes to making various projects and putting them online where they are easily accessable, and also composing and writing my thoughts and techniques I have while creating projects.

Anyway, I am a sophomore at LASA High School, which opens me up to a lot of Computer Science classes, like "AP CompSci", which I took last year, and "Web and Mobile Applications" which I am currently taking. I plan on posting on most of the projects that I do in the class, and maybe on some slightly older ones that were especially educational, with elements I could utilize in future personal projects.

**Thanks for reading, I hope to continue posting and delevoping!**
