ZapMath is a project I made over thanksgiving break, aiming to expand my javascript skills and actually start creating.
I learned a lot about music, tab icons, and javascript commands. It is a basic math game where you can choose between a series of 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division problems. If you get one right, you gain ten points and a couple seconds
back on the time limit. If you are incorrect, however, you lose 5 points and are stuck on the same question.

The methods I used where definitely not optimized, but I had less knowledge on linking different html pages together,
so that is the reason the whole game takes place in one file. The project gave me a grasp on what I could accomplish at the time,
and was self-esteem boosting because it looked semi-decent and plays like a real browser game. Once I uploaded it to a subdomain,
I realized when I checked it out on my phone that the graphics do not translate to a mobile version. In the future I will 
definitely look into possible solutions for this problem.
